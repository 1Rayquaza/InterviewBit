X = Distance between the head(starting) to the loop starting point.

C = The distance of the loop
X = K * C â€“ Y, where K is some positive constant.

Now if reset the slow pointer to the head(starting position) and move both fast and slow pointer by one unit
at a time, both of them will meet after travelling X distance at the meeting point
